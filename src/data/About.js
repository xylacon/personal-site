			<h2>About Me</h2>
			My name is Richard Dylan Denton and I am a passionate developer with a B.S. in Computer Science. I graduated from the University of Houston first with a B.A. in Music and a minor in Management Information Systems, where I was introduced to web development. <br />
			<br />

			<h3>Lifespan Psychiatry</h3>
			After graduation, I helped start <a className='link markdown' href="https://www.lifespanpsychwc.com/" target='_blank' rel="noreferrer">Lifespan Psychiatry & Wellness Center</a>. I researched business compliance, constructed legal documents, established advertising, and prospected clients. <br />
			<br />
			The remainder of my time there consisted of accounting, managing patient data, billing insurance companies, and researching business strategies. <br />
			<br />
			During this time, I also worked on solo projects in web development and gained valuable experience in React. My plan was to eventually get a job in software development, but due to mass layoffs and gaining interest in computer science, I decided to return to school. <br />
			<br />

			<h3>Back to school</h3>
			I re-enrolled at the University of Houston in Spring 2023 and embarked on an awesome 2-year journey to get my CS degree. Coming back to school not only allowed me to get the education I desired but also make new friends, work on projects, and get research experience. <br />
			<br />

			<h3>Hobbies</h3>
			Beyond development, I also enjoy photography. <br />
