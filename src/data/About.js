			<h2>About Me</h2>
			My name is Richard Dylan Denton and I am a passionate developer with a B.S. in Computer Science. I graduated from the University of Houston first with a B.A. in Music and a minor in Management Information Systems, where I was introduced to web development. <br />
			<br />

			<h3>Lifespan Psychiatry</h3>
			After graduation, I helped start <a className='link markdown' href="https://www.lifespanpsychwc.com/" target='_blank' rel="noreferrer">Lifespan Psychiatry & Wellness Center</a>. I researched business compliance, constructed legal documents, established advertising, and prospected clients. <br />
			<br />
			The remainder of my time there consisted of accounting, managing patient data, billing insurance companies, and researching business strategies. <br />
			<br />
			During this time, I also worked on solo projects in web development and gained valuable experience in React. My plan was to eventually get a job in software development, but due to mass layoffs and gaining interest in computer science, I decided to return to school. <br />
			<br />

			<h3>Back to school</h3>
			I re-enrolled at the University of Houston in Spring 2023 and embarked on an awesome 2-year journey to get my CS degree. Coming back to school not only allowed me to get the education I desired but also make new friends, work on projects, and get research experience. <br />
			<br />

			<h3>Hobbies</h3>
			Beyond development, I also enjoy music and photography. <br />
			<br />

			<h4>Music</h4>
			I started teaching myself piano during high school after seeing Elton John in Beaumont, TX. Learning was hard at first because I refused to use any outside sources to help me learn; I instead wanted to discover the instrument in my own way and learn by ear. <br />
			<br />
			Eventually, I became proficient enough to get accepted into the <a className='link markdown' href="https://uh.edu/kgmca/music/" target='_blank' rel="noreferrer">Moores School of Music</a>, where I was able to learn music in a classical manner and underwent rigorous training in piano. <br />
			<br />
			These days, I simply enjoy playing piano when I'm bored or just need to jam. Occasionally, I'll write/record some music or perform for family/friends. <br />
			<br />

			<h4>Photography</h4>
			Since I was young, I had always enjoyed using cameras and maximizing the photos I could take with my iPod. As the years went on, I eventually created an <a className='link markdown' href="https://www.instagram.com/xylacon/" target='_blank' rel="noreferrer">Instagram</a> to post my photography. <br />
			<br />
			Once I made the decision to buy a professional camera (Sony A7-II), I learned Adobe Lightroom and Photoshop so that I could make the most out of my photos. My favorite part about this hobby is how peaceful the process is.
