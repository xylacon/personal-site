			Those who have coded before may recognize this site's design as VS Code, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) beloved by many. I appreciate its minimal design, powerful tools, and massive library of extensions which allows VS Code to do pretty much anything. With these attributes in mind, I decided to model my personal site after this great tool.  <br />
